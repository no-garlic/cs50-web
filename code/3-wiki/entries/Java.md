## Overview

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent.  "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) is a key principle, meaning Java code can run on any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. It’s widely used for enterprise applications, Android app development, and more.

## History

*   **1995:** Developed by James Gosling and a team at Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle).
*   **Initial Goal:** To create a language suitable for interactive television.
*   **Evolution:**  Has undergone numerous versions and updates, continually improving performance and adding new features.
*   **Oracle’s Acquisition:** Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, becoming the primary steward of the Java platform.

## Core Features

*   **Object-Oriented:** Java is based on the object-oriented programming paradigm, promoting code reusability and modularity.
*   **Platform Independent:** The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows Java code to run on any operating system.
*   **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection):**  The JVM automatically manages memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
*   **Robust and Secure:** Java includes features like exception handling and security mechanisms.
*   **Large Ecosystem:** A vast collection of libraries and frameworks are available for various tasks.

## Compatibility

Java enjoys excellent compatibility across a wide range of platforms.

*   **Operating Systems:** Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems.
*   **JVM Support:** The availability of JVMs ensures compatibility across different hardware architectures.
*   **Web Browsers:** Java applets (though less common now) were previously supported in web browsers.
