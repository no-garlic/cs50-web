## Overview

C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a powerful and versatile general-purpose programming language. It's an extension of the C language, incorporating object-oriented programming (OOP) features alongside procedural programming capabilities.  C++ is widely used in a vast range of applications, from operating systems and game development to high-performance computing, embedded systems, and financial modeling.  It's known for its efficiency, control over hardware, and ability to create complex and sophisticated software.

## History

*   **1979:** Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as "C with Classes." Initially, it was intended as a way to add object-oriented features to C.
*   **1983:** Officially named C++.
*   **Early 1990s:** Significant improvements and standardization efforts led to the first ISO C++ standard (C++98).
*   **2003:** C++03 introduced features like namespaces and range-based for loops.
*   **2009:** C++11 marked a major release, introducing many modern features like lambda expressions, smart pointers, and concurrency support.
*   **2011:** C++14 added further refinements.
*   **2017:** C++17 introduced features like structured bindings and inline variables.
*   **2020:** C++20 brought improvements to concepts, coroutines, and more.
*   **2023:** C++23 continues to evolve with improvements and new features.

## Core Features

C++ boasts a rich set of features, including:

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Supports concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
*   **Low-Level Memory Management:** Provides control over memory allocation and deallocation (using `new` and `delete`, or smart pointers).
*   **Templates:** Enables generic programming, allowing code to work with different data types without being rewritten for each type.
*   **Standard Template Library (STL):** A collection of pre-built data structures (vectors, lists, maps) and algorithms.
*   **Exception Handling:**  A mechanism for dealing with runtime errors gracefully.
*   **Operator Overloading:** Allows you to redefine the behavior of operators for user-defined types.
*   **Multiple Programming Paradigms:** Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming styles.



## Compatibility

C++ is highly portable, meaning code written for one platform can often be compiled and run on another with minimal changes.

*   **Operating Systems:**  C++ is supported on virtually all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems.
*   **Compilers:**  A wide variety of compilers are available for C++, including:
    *   GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
    *   Clang
    *   Microsoft Visual C++
*   **Standards Compliance:**  Modern C++ compilers strive to adhere to the latest C++ standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23) to ensure code portability and consistency.
