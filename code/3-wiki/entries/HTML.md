## Overview

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.  It's the foundation upon which all websites are built.

## History

*   **1991:** Developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.

*   **Evolution:**  Has evolved significantly over time, incorporating new features and standards.
*   **Standardization:**  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains the HTML standard.

## Core Features

HTML uses tags to define elements on a webpage:

*   **Tags:**  Keywords enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) that tell the browser how to display content.
*   **Elements:**  A tag and its content (e.g., `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`).
*   **Common Tags:**
    *   `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings
    *   `<p>`: Paragraph
    *   `<a>`: Link
    *   `<img>`: Image
    *   `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Unordered and ordered lists
    *   `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`: Tables

HTML enjoys universal compatibility across virtually all web browsers and devices.

*   **Browser Support:** All major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) support HTML.
*   **Device Compatibility:**  HTML is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
