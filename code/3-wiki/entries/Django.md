## Overview

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "batteries included" philosophy, providing many features out of the box, and is particularly well-suited for building complex, database-driven websites and web applications. Django emphasizes security and rapid development, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## History

*   **2008:** Developed by Adrian Holovaty and Stuart Taylor.
*   **Initial Goals:** To create a robust and scalable web framework for Python, addressing the challenges of building complex web applications.
*   **Influences:** Heavily influenced by Ruby on Rails and other "convention over configuration" frameworks.

*   **Ongoing Development:** Continuously updated and improved by a large and active community.

## Core Features

Django provides a comprehensive set of tools and features:

*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** Simplifies database interactions, allowing you to work with data using Python objects instead of raw SQL.
*   **Template Engine:**  A powerful system for creating dynamic web pages, separating presentation from application logic.

*   **URL Routing:**  Defines how URLs map to views (functions that generate the content to be displayed).
*   **Middleware:**  Allows you to intercept and modify requests and responses.



## Compatibility

Django enjoys excellent compatibility across a wide range of platforms and environments.

*   **Operating Systems:**  Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Web Servers:** Compatible with popular web servers like Apache and Nginx.
