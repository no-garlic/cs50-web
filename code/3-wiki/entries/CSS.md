## Overview

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of an HTML or XML document.  Essentially, it controls *how* an HTML document looks – things like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsiveness.  CSS separates the *structure* of a website (HTML) from its *style*, making websites easier to maintain and update.  It's a fundamental technology for web design and development.

## History

*   **1996:** Developed by Håkon Wium Lie as a response to the limitations of inline styling.
*   **Initial Goal:** To provide a standardized way to style web pages, addressing the chaotic proliferation of individual browser stylesheets.
*   **Early Versions:** Initial versions focused on basic styling properties.
*   **Key Developments:**
    *   **Selectors:** Introduced to target specific HTML elements for styling.
    *   **Box Model:**  A fundamental concept for understanding how elements are rendered (content, padding, border, margin).
    *   **Cascading:** The core principle of CSS, allowing multiple style rules to coexist and resolve conflicts based on specificity and order.
    *   **Modern CSS (CSS3 and beyond):**  Expanded capabilities dramatically, including animations, transitions, media queries (for responsive design), and more.

## Core Features

CSS provides a powerful set of features for controlling the appearance of web pages:

*   **Selectors:**  Used to target HTML elements for styling (e.g., `p`, `h1`, `.class-name`, `#id-name`).
*   **Properties:**  Define the visual characteristics of elements (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `background-color`).
*   **Values:**  Specify the values for CSS properties (e.g., `red`, `16px`, `10px`, `auto`).
*   **Box Model:**  Controls the layout of elements, including content, padding, border, and margin.
*   **Layout Techniques:**  Includes methods like Flexbox and Grid for creating complex and responsive layouts.
*   **Animations & Transitions:**  Allows for dynamic visual effects.


## Compatibility

CSS is *extremely* widely supported across all modern web browsers and devices.

*   **Browser Support:**  Virtually all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera) fully support CSS.
*   **Device Support:**  CSS is essential for responsive design, ensuring websites adapt to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
*   **Standards-Based:**  CSS is based on web standards, promoting interoperability and consistency.
