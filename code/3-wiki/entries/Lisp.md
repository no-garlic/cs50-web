## Overview

Lisp (LISt Processor) is a family of programming languages known for its unique syntax and powerful capabilities.  It’s characterized by its use of lists as the fundamental data structure and its homoiconic nature – meaning code and data are treated identically. Lisp is often praised for its flexibility and expressiveness, making it well-suited for AI research and symbolic computation.

## History

*   **1958:** Developed by John McCarthy at MIT.
*   **Early AI Research:** Initially designed for artificial intelligence research, particularly symbolic reasoning.
*   **Evolution:**  Numerous dialects have evolved over time, including Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure.
*   **Continued Relevance:**  Despite its age, Lisp remains influential in areas like AI and functional programming.

## Core Features

*   **Homoiconicity:** Code and data are represented in the same format (lists), allowing for powerful metaprogramming.
*   **Symbolic Computation:**  Excellent for manipulating symbols and representing knowledge.
*   **Functional Programming:**  Lisp strongly supports functional programming paradigms, emphasizing immutability and pure functions.
*   **Macros:**  Powerful macro systems enable code generation and transformation at compile time.
*   **Dynamic Typing:**  Variable types are checked at runtime, providing flexibility.

## Compatibility

Lisp’s compatibility depends on the specific dialect.

*   **Multiple Platforms:**  Many Lisp implementations are available for various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):**  Interactive Lisp environments (REPLs) are common, facilitating experimentation and rapid prototyping.
*   **Dialect-Specific:**  Compatibility varies depending on the chosen Lisp dialect (e.g., Common Lisp, Scheme).
