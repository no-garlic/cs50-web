## Overview

C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency, control over hardware, and widespread use in system programming. Itâ€™s a foundational language that has influenced many subsequent languages, including C++, Java, and Python. C is often used for developing operating systems, embedded systems, game development, and high-performance applications.

## History

*   **1972:** Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as a system programming language for the Unix operating system.
*   **Early Goals:** To create a language that was both efficient and easy to use for system programming.
*   **Unix Development:** C became the primary language for developing Unix and its derivatives.
*   **ANSI C (C89/C90):**  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standardized the language in 1989, promoting portability.
*   **C99:** Introduced improvements and new features in 1999.
*   **C11 & C18:** Further refinements and additions in subsequent standards.

## Core Features

C provides a rich set of features for building complex software:

*   **Procedural Programming:** C is primarily a procedural language, emphasizing step-by-step instructions.
*   **Pointers:** A key feature of C, allowing direct manipulation of memory addresses.
*   **Data Types:** Supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and arrays.
*   **Functions:**  C uses functions to organize code and promote reusability.
*   **Structures:**  Allows grouping related data items into a single unit.
*   **Memory Management:**  C requires manual memory management (using `malloc` and `free`).



## Compatibility

C enjoys exceptionally broad compatibility across a vast range of platforms and operating systems.

*   **Portability:** C code is highly portable, meaning it can be compiled and run on many different architectures.
*   **Operating Systems:**  C is used on virtually all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems.
*   **Compiler Availability:**  C compilers are readily available for numerous platforms.
