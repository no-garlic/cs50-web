Todo:
- move views into separate files
- move css, images, and js into subdirs
- create admin classes and register them


Why more complex:
- javascript for creating a quiz
- bootstrap icons, google fonts
- multiple stylesheets
- landing page
- more professional looking css
- properly support responsiveness
- full error checking from all views, and in javascript
- more complex schema - saving a quiz is multiple entries in multiple tables
- similarity search with vector database


Put into readme:
- generate a project description from gpt
- schema from miro
- ui design from miro
