Todo:
- move views into separate files
- move css, images, and js into subdirs
- create admin classes and register them
- requirements.txt
- try to refactor CSS so it looks less like it was done with gpt
- remove unused CSS
- can some of the CSS styles be combined & simplified?
- refactor javascript to look more hand written, and use snake case
- update scemantic search when adding a quiz
- update the migration to add multiple scores for each user
- left margin for sidebar is broken


Why more complex:
- javascript for creating a quiz
- bootstrap icons, google fonts
- multiple stylesheets
- landing page
- more professional looking css
- properly support responsiveness
- full error checking from all views, and in javascript
- more complex schema - saving a quiz is multiple entries in multiple tables
- similarity search with vector database


Put into readme:
- generate a project description from gpt
- schema from miro
- ui design from miro


Requirements:
- faiss-cpu
- sentence-transformers
- numpy
