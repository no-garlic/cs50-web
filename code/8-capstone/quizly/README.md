Why more complex:

- javascript for creating a quiz
- bootstrap icons, google fonts
- multiple stylesheets
- landing page
- more professional looking css
- properly support responsiveness
- full error checking from all views, and in javascript
- more complex schema - saving a quiz is multiple entries in multiple tables
- similarity search with vector database
